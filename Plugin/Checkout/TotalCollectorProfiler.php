/**
 * Times one quote totals collector: "TOTALS:Total\Shipping".
 *
 * Totals collection is the single most expensive thing a checkout does, and it runs again on every
 * quote change - every qty edit, every address change, every coupon attempt. It is also the classic
 * place a third-party extension quietly costs a second: collectors are configured in sales.xml and
 * run in sequence, so one slow one is charged to a page that looks like it is doing nothing.
 *
 * The companion to TotalsProfiler, which times the whole pass. Without this one a slow checkout is a
 * single large number with nothing to attribute it to, and a wall of SQL rows underneath that never
 * names the collector that issued them.
 *
 * Wired on CollectorInterface, not on AbstractTotal: a collector is only required to implement the
 * interface, and hooking the abstract class would silently miss any that do not extend it - which,
 * being third-party, are exactly the ones worth timing.
 *
 * A class of its own rather than a second method on TotalsProfiler. Magento matches plugin methods by
 * name against whatever type the plugin is declared on, and TotalsCollector has a collect() of its own
 * with an entirely different signature - so one class serving both types has aroundCollect() applied
 * to both, and the wrong one fatals on the type hint.
