/**
 * Times controller dispatch: "CONTROLLER:catalog_product_view".
 *
 * Core times controllers, but only the ones extending the deprecated Magento\Framework\App\Action\Action
 * base class, which emits CONTROLLER_ACTION:<full action name> from its dispatch(). Controllers that
 * implement ActionInterface directly - the modern majority, and every Hyva controller - go through
 * FrontController::processRequest, which has no per-action timer at all. Between the root "magento"
 * timer and the individual SQL and cache rows there is currently nothing.
 *
 * That gap is the one this module already fills for the other two request types: a REST call reports
 * WEBAPI:<METHOD> <route> and a GraphQL call reports GRAPHQL:query. A storefront or adminhtml page had
 * no equivalent. This is it.
 *
 * Unlike most instrumentation here there is no area flag. It is one timer per request - too cheap to be
 * worth a switch, and the row every other row hangs underneath.
