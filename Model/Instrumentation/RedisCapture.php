/**
 * Turns a Redis command and its arguments into the payload a span carries under MAGE_PROFILER_REDIS.
 *
 * The counterpart to QueryCapture, and deliberately its mirror image: a timer id says a command ran
 * and how long it took, and the row above says which cache asked for it, but neither says *what was
 * on the wire*. "MGET (BLOCK)" does not tell you it fetched forty keys, and "SETEX (PRODUCT_LISTING_SORT)"
 * does not tell you it wrote 80 KB.
 *
 * The payload is written into the same span fields the SQL capture uses - `sql` for the command line
 * and `binds` for the value arguments - so anything already reading a captured SQL statement renders
 * it unchanged. The field names are a small lie in the JSON; a second pair of keys a reader did not
 * know about would have been a bigger one.
 *
 * Security: this writes fragments of whatever is in the cache, and the cache holds rendered blocks -
 * customer names, addresses, cart contents. Treat a report recorded with this on the way you would
 * treat the cache itself. The controls are the flag being off by default and the truncation below;
 * as with SQL binds, no value redaction is attempted, because a cache payload carries no column names
 * and any heuristic would be theatre.
